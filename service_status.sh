# Custom Service with systemd

# Create a simple shell script (e.g., one that prints “Service Running” every 10 seconds).
# Register it as a systemd service.
# Practice enabling, disabling, starting, stopping, and checking its logs with journalctl.


#!/bin/bash

while true; do
   echo "Service is running"
   echo "----------------------------"
   sleep 10
done
